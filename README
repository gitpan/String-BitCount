The String::BitCount module for perl5 may be used to determine the
number of one bits in strings and to show the number of bits in each
byte of a string.

To install this module, cd to the directory that this README file is
in and type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

The 'make test' line is optional.

Documentation for this module is part of the file BitCount.pm using
the pod (Plain Old Documentation) format.  To convert it into manual
page format, type something like the following:

	pod2man BitCount.pm > BitCount.man

To convert it into html format, type:

	pod2html BitCount.pm

(pod2html automatically creates a file named BitCount.html)
